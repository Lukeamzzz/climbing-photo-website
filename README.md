# Climbing photography project website
## Description
This project combines my three biggest passions: climbing, photography, and coding. 

Climbing offers exhilarating experiences which I capture through my lens as a photographer. As a programmer, I bring these experiences to the web. 

Think of this project as a mashup of my hobbies, blended to showcase the beauty of climbing through a visually engaging platform.
